### ABOUT ME

 #### *I was a computer science and programming enthusiast since the year 1991 when I read a book about the BASIC programming language for the first time. I've tried many courses and learned some concepts and algorithms, but unfortunately didn't finish one mostly for the decreesing motivation due impossible to realize my new knowlege. Nevetheless easch time I learned more and my previous experience help me to get in faster. Now I put all my efforts into achieving my goal of becoming a Front-End Developer.*

### CODE SAMPLES

#### PYTHON
##### **A DICE ROLLER**
```
import random
dice_qty = int(input('How many dices do you want to roll ?')) # getting amount of dices
dices= {}
for i in range (1, (dice_qty  + 1)):                          # finding out how many side each dice is  
    if i == 1:
        message = 'How many sides is your first dice ?'
    elif i == dice_qty:
        message = 'How many sides is your last dice ?'
    else:
        message = 'How many sides is your next dice ?'
    sides = int(input(message))
    dices[i] = sides                                          # forming a dictionary, where key is an index number of a dice and a value is a number of sides
dice_index = 1         
while dice_index < dice_qty + 1:  
     roll = random.randint(1, dices[dice_index])
     print(' Your  {} dice ( {}  sides ) has rolled {} !'.format(dice_index, dices[dice_index], roll))# printing out results
     dice_index += 1
